# vue-clock

Vue.js components for implementing clocks, timers and countdowns


## Introduction

`vue-clock` is a simple set of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) components for implementing time-oriented widgets on your site. It's designed to be flexible both in the range of tools available (clocks, timers, countdows, etc.), as well as in how you're able to design their appearance. It relies heavily on the excellent framework, [moment.js](https://momentjs.com), and you're encouraged to check out moment's documentation to get an idea of what this library is doing.


## Usage and Installation

If you're incorporating `vue-clock` into your already-awesome Vue project, complete with Node-based dev and build environments, you've probably already figured out you can get started with just:

```
$ npm install --save vue-clock
```

You can, of course, also just simply pull in `vue-clock` with a script tag:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@2.3.2/dist/vue.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-clock/dist/vue-clock.min.js"></script>
```
