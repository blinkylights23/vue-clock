# vue-clock

Vue.js components for implementing clocks, timers and countdowns


## Introduction

`vue-clock` is a simple set of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) components for implementing time-oriented widgets on your site. It's designed to be flexible both in the range of tools available (clocks, timers, countdows, etc.), as well as in how you're able to design their appearance. It relies heavily on the excellent framework, [moment.js](https://momentjs.com), and you're encouraged to check out moment's documentation to get an idea of what this library is doing.


## Installation

If you're incorporating `vue-clock` into your already-awesome Vue project, complete with modern babel-y webpack'ed Node-ish build tooling, you've probably already figured out you can get started with just:

```
$ npm install --save vue-clock
```

For more information on how to set up such an environment, check out [Vue's user guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) (which is excellent). I can also recommend the excellent video tutorials for Vue at [egghead.io](http://egghead.io), and you may also find the [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) instructive if not useful.

You can, of course, also pull in `vue-clock` with a script tag:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue/dist/vue.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-clock/dist/vue-clock.min.js"></script>
```

`vue-clock` provides a set of Vue _components_, so you may find it useful to [check out the documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html) on how that part of the framework works.
